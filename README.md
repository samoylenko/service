Originally written and compiled using MSVC98, this code was updated by Michael Maltsev ([@m417z](https://github.com/m417z)) to allow compilation using newer Visual Studio versions

**NOTE**: This code was written in early 2000s, and was used with Windows
XP/2000. If you are looking to write a Windows service, please check updated
